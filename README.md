# Hi, This is Sundar 👋 🧑🏽‍💻

![](https://github.com/Msundarv/Msundarv/blob/master/intro.gif)

Working with computers has always been my passion, and programming is what gives my life a meaning. I love to work on Frontier Technologies involving Machine Intelligence like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Time Series Analysis. I believe they can better serve humanity, and I want to be a part of it.
